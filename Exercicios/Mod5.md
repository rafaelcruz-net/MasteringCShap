# EXERCISE MODULE 5

#### 1 - Write a program in C# Sharp to create a file and add some text.

> Expected Output:
>
> A file created with content name mytest.txt 

#### 2 -  Write a program in C# Sharp to create a file with text and read the file. 

>Expected Output :
>Here is the content of the file mytest.txt :                                                     
>Hello and Welcome

>of the text file mytest.txt 

#### 3 - Write a program in C# Sharp to append some text to an existing file

>Expected Output :
> Here is the content of the file mytest.txt:                                                    
Hello and Welcome                                                                                 
It is the first content of the text file mytest.txt                                               

>Here is the content of the file after appending the text:                                        
Hello and Welcome                                                                                 
It is the first content of the text file mytest.txt                                               
This is the line appended at last line. 


#### 4 - Create a class with three properties and create three methods. Each one to serialize the class in one output: XML, Json, Binary


#### 5 - You are a developer working for Fourth Coffee. A bug has been raised and you have been asked to investigate. To help reproduce the error, you have decided to add some logic to persist the state of the application to disk, when the application encounters the error. All the types in the application are serializable, and it would be advantageous if the persisted state was human readable. What approach will you take?


#### 6 - You are a developer working for Fourth Coffee. You have been asked to write some code to process a 100 GB video file. Your code needs to transfer the file from one location on disk, to another location on disk, without reading the entire file into memory. Which classes would you use to read and write the file?
(   )Option 1: The MemoryStream, BinaryReader and BinaryWriter classes.
(   )Option 2: The FileStream, BinaryReader and BinaryWriter classes.
(   )Option 3: The BinaryReader and BinaryWriter classes.
(   )Option 4: The FileStream, StreamReader and StreamWriter classes.
(   )Option 5: The MemoryStream, StreamReader and StreamWriter classes.
